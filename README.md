After starting development of React apps, I started to do the same things over and over again. I decided to put all those stuff into this public library.  

## Usage
If you are looking for live demonstration and code examples, please visit https://gabbersepp.github.io/react-components/.

### Install with npm

The package is available at npm. 

```
npm install jb-react-components
```

To apply the styling, import the stylesheet:

```js
import "jb-react-components/dist/jb-react-components.css"
```

### Use without npm

Include following HTML code:

```html
<!-- include javascript and stylesheet -->
<link href="/path/to/jb-react-components.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="/path/to/jb-react-components.js"></script>
```

### Peer dependencies

The components are built against React v16.x. But as they are without very complexe stuff, other versions should be applicable, too.
